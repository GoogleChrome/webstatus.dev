## Overview

[webstatus.dev](https://webstatus.dev) is a tool to monitor and track the status
of all Web Platform features across dimensions that are related to availability
across browsers, and adoption and usage by web developers.

This tool utilizes [workflows](./workflows/) to ingest data from different
public sources such as:

- [Browser Compat Data](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data)
- [Web Platform Tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt)
- [Web Features](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features)

The tool serves this data through a Go [backend](./backend/) via an API
described in a [OpenAPI](./openapi/backend/openapi.yaml) document.

The tool provides a [frontend](./frontend/) dashboard written in Typescript to
display the data.

## Search Syntax

webstatus.dev provides a powerful search feature to help you find the
information you need. To learn more about the search syntax and its
capabilities, please refer to our [Search Syntax Guide](./antlr/FeatureSearch.md).

## Get the code

This repository relies heavily on [devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/create-dev-container) to get started.

To continue setting up locally:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/GoogleChrome/webstatus.dev
code webstatus.dev # Opens Visual Studio Code with the webstatus.dev folder.

# While inside Visual Studio Code, start the devcontainer.
# Start it by:
# 1. Opening the Command Palette (via View -> Command Palette)
# 2. Select the option: Dev containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container
```

### Running the services locally

After getting the code with or without devcontainer, check out the [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md) for more information to get started and running locally.
